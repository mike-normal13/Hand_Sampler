//  1:      DON'T DEAL WITH FILE LOADING MEMORY UNTIL THE PADCONFIG NO LONGER INUNDATES THE CONSOLE WITH CONSTRTAINT ERRORS.
//      we have memory warning handling due to file loading/recording in place,
//      however much like when we try to deallocate songs,
//          we do not see an immediate dip in memory usage...
//              MEMORY LEAK!
//  2:      as of 11/1/2017 the app seems to be less leaky than it was before....
//      we have songs being deallocated when the memory warning ocurrs,
//          however the deallocation does not seem to have any impact on the apps memory usage....
//          https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html
//          we are anticipating three scenarios which will result in didRecieveMemoryWarning() being called:
//              1:  The user chooses to launch a song which results in running out of memory.
//              2:  The user loads a sound into a pad which results in running out of memory.
//              3:  The user records a sound into a pad which results in running out of memory.
//          There are two possible ways of handling these three scenarios:
//              1:  release the memory of any songs that are currently loaded besides the current song
//              2:  Alert the user that the sound being loaded or recorded is too large,
//                      and skip loading it into the pad.
//          We currently do not have any code in play which handels warning in case of loading or recording a file.
//              having the didReceiveMemoryWarning() method in a seperate class lower in the heirarchy might be an option...
//          Which VCs could be visible when a warning ocurrs
//              1:  SamplerConfigVC -> bankVC
//                      warning would happen here as a result of the user loading a song.
//                          WE PRETTY much have this case handled..
//              2:  fileSelctorVC -> padConfigVC
//                      warning would happen here as a result of the user loading a sound.
//              3:  recordVC -> PadConfigVC
//                      warning would happen here as a result of the user recording a sound.
//          IF YOU have VC class with didReceiveMemoryWarning() defined,
//              and if said class is not nil when the memory warning occurs
//                  then didReceiveMemoryWarning() will be called in that class.
//              Yes,
//                  for each memory warning that occurrs,
//                      each non nil class with didReceiveMemoryWarning() defined will have its didReceiveMemoryWarning() called.
//          RIGHT NOW 10/23/2017,
//              there is an issue of inconsistency as to which definition of didReceiveMemoryWarning gets called first....
//                  And we are hanving trouble handling .isVisible in the PadConfigVC because the SongTVC immediatly shows an AlerVC....
//          IF WE ditch the didREceive in the PadConfigVC,
//              we could have a _loadFile flag
//                  which indicates whether the the current load action is a result of song loading or file/recording loading.
//                      and then just have that flag be adjusted every time either a song is loaded, or a file is loaded or recorded.
//                          and we couyld have said adjust ment take place via observers and notifications....
//  3: Media Server Reset?
//          WE SHOULD SPEND NO MORE THAN 1 HOUR AT A TIME ON THIS!
//              IT IS NOT NEARLY AS HIGH A PRIORITY AS OTHER THINGS!
//          My guess is that we are not disposing of things properly when the reset ocurrs.
//          https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Audio/Conceptual/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide/HandlingAudioInterruptions/HandlingAudioInterruptions.html
//              Handling the reset on each VC:
//                  SongTVC: if the reset occurs before moving to any SamplerConfigVC the app does not crash
//                            IF the reset occurs after we have moved back from a SamplerConfigVC without moving to a BankVC the app does not crash.
//                          The app crashes if we have moved to a BankVC with or without loaded sounds
//                              and then we move back to the SongTVC as soon as the alert is dismissed.
//                  SamplerConfigVC:
//                          If the reset occurrs before moving to a BankVC the app does not crash
//      WE LEFT OFF on implementing the popToSamplerConfigVCIfNeeded() method....
//      11/9/2017: we get a run time exception after we try to present the AlertVC,
//                  try stepping into the present call.
//      on 11/15/2017:
//          we saw the media server reset alert screen pop up by itself when we disconected the phone from the machine
//              while the app was running from a launch initiated by the machine........
//  9: look into those two exceptions uncoverd by the exception break point
//          __cxa_throw and objc_exception_throw
//              for __cxa_throw:
//                  in the master sound mod,
//                      it might be a good idea to get rid of the _mainMixer member and simply just refer to,
//                          self._engine.mainMixerNode.....
//                              but once this is done we need to test for a variety of things....
//                      the call in connectPadToMixer in MasterSoundMod to connect a padMixer to the engine is hanging up on __cxa_throw,
//                              I have no idea why......
//          for objc_exception_throw:
//                  on 11/21/2017 we launched a song and when we got to the bankVC the exception was not thrown,
//                      the padCOnfigVC was broken at the time so we were unable to dig deeper.
//                  on 11/25/2017 we explored all screens,
//                      the exception was not thrown,
//                          we did NOT load a file or make a recording.......

//          THE FROZEN APP BUG
//          11/30/2017
//          YOU NEED TO BE COMPLETELY FOCUSED TO SOLVE THIS!!!
//              We were testing moving to and from SIRI while a song was loading.
//                  once we got the the bankVC the app was frozen and seems to be ignoring interaction events,
//                      the weird thing is that the last print out about interaction events is this:
//                          resetPadColors() in BankVC began ignoring interaction events
//                          resetPadColors() in BankVC stopped ignoring interaction events
//                          applicationDidBecomeActive in AppDelegate stopped ignoring application interaction events
//                              we were able to get the app to snap out of it via the home button.
//              12/10/2017:
//                  this bug seems to be harder to trigger now,
//                      however we did see it happen and we saw the printout:
//                          [AnyHashable("AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeKey"): 1]
//                              setUpAudioInterruptionNotification() in AppDelegate Application began ignoring interaction events. Thread:
//                       the print out:
//                          [AnyHashable("AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeKey"): 1] seems to be invloved with the halting
//  11: DEBUG: MasterSoundMod
//          11/30/2017 -- we need to retest this due some recent changes to the master sound mod....
//              We were testing moving the app to and from teh back ground via the home button while a song was loading(go to song button)
//                  On the 16th try we moved the app to and from the background a few time while the app was loading,
//                      we moved to the third bank,
//                          we presssed one of the pads and started seeing the bad connection alert,
//                              the reconnection process did not seem to work after several tries,
//                                  and we kept getting bad connection alerts over and over again
//                                      the case being triggered in the checkForPadConnection() method is:
//                                          if(padMixerInConnectionPoint == nil)
//                                      In this if statement there is no call to try to reconnect the node......
//                  On 12/2/2017 we 20/20 passes....
//         12/10/2017:
//              THIS IS NO LONGER BULLET PROOF!
//                  IT SEEMS LIKE A CALL TO STARTMOD() IN MASTER SOUND MODE IS CAUSING THE AVAudioSessionErrorCodeCannotStartPlaying ERROR...
//          12/11/2017:
//              in startMod in MasterSoundMod we now check to see if the engine is running before we attempt to start it,
//                  ON THE 22ND TRY we saw the 561015905 error
//                      print out:
//                          +++++++applicationDidBecomeActive in AppDelegate stopped ignoring application interaction events

//                          SO IT LOOKS AS though a call to reconnectPadMixersAfterRouteChange()
//                              and a call to startMod() are happening at the same time on separate threads.....
//  14: TODO:   RecordVC
//              the binary search extension at the bottom of SyncTransmitter did not work for us when checking for duplicate names.
//              the high variable would get stuck and we enter an infinite loop.
//                  it would be nice to not to have to do a linear search when checking for duplicte file names
//                      maybe the array we get from the loader is not sorted.....

//                  the activity indicator stops animating.
//                      this seems to be happening insonsistently
//          11/4/2017:
//              we have the code in place
//                  there is a delay in the activity indicator starting reanimating.
//                  My guess is that we need to do the same sort of thing that we did in starting the activity indicator in the samplerConfigVC...
//          11/9/2017:
//              scrap the call that trickles down from the appDelegate
//                  Instead have the FileSelectorCell class have an observer which waits for the UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification...
//                      //              once we get this working remove the code starting in the AppDelegate.
//          12/10/2017:
//              it seems that even the observer-notifiaction method does not work
//                  because the observer method does not get called until after the sound mod is restarted and reconnected,
//                      by this time the file is already loaded......
//          This is not a huge priority
//  20: FileSelectorCell -- go 20/20
//          on 12/9/2017,

//                  presssed the home button while the file was loading and the app crashed.
//                      don't know why.....
//                  It happened three times(with the dilla beat),
//                          one or more times the activity indicator was not stopped
//                      having trouble triggering the bug while connected...

//                  if we want to fix this

//          12/28/2017
//          it is possible to spastically press pads and accedentally move to the padConfigVC twice,
//              we saw an instance where this made the app crash due to runtime error
//                  complaining about pushing the same VC twice.....
//          on 12/29/2017 we were unable to get the bug to manifest even when we decreased the pan velocity threshold fro the padView...
//          on 1/12/2018 we wer again unseccuessful in torggering the bug
//  1: FileSelectorVC
//          1/9/2018
//          some of the atari sounds take too long to start previewing,
//              don't know why,
//                  there is an AVAudioFile or AVAudioPlayer init that takes in a hint arg,
//                      we should look into faster previewing
//                          because at this point the access to the _indexDictionary should be constant!!!!
//  2: SongVC
//          1/10/2018
//          momentary highligthing of the selected cell will be easy to pull off with a notificationt/observer
//          once any SamplerConfigVC appears just post a notification telling the cells to set their background color back to black,
//  3: SamplerConfigVC
//          12/28/2017
//              something is up with renaming a song that has missing files.
//                  we see the missing file alert,
//                      but the pads that have the missing files have sounds in them...
//                          I think the sounds are the sounds which were loaded before we switched to the sounds that were erased....
//  18: DEBUG: FileSelectorCell
//          12/20/2017
//          On Dad's iPad.
//          the cells are white as soon as the FileSelectorVC appears,
//              they turn yellow during previewing,
//                  once they are released they turn gray
